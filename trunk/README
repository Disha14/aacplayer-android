        (path to Android SDK)

    2) copy sample.ant.properties to .ant.properties and edit it
        (path to Android NDK)

    3) run ant

    4) install the APK on the emulator or a device:

    The compile script was tested on linux platform and there is

RUNNING
=======

There are two options of playing AAC files:
    1) playing using the FAAD2 decoder native library
            + should work on all 1.5+ platforms
            - slow on emulator
            - patent license is needed

    2) playing using an internal AAC decoder (HTC Desire) by splitting the
        stream into small file chunks (having the ".aac" suffix)
            - only some devices support this
            - does not work on emulator
            - the playing is not smooth
